# This Is A MERN STACK Example

# About This Project

What is a MERN Stack?
The MERN stack is a popular and powerful technology stack used for building web applications. It's an acronym that stands for:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. MongoDB is known for its scalability and ability to handle large amounts of data.

Express.js : A back-end web application framework for Node.js. Express simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications by providing a set of features and middleware for routing, handling requests and responses, and more.

React : A front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces efficiently. It follows a component-based architecture, making it easy to manage and reuse UI components.

NodeJS : A server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server. Node.js is used in conjunction with Express.js to build the server-side logic of MERN applications.

## How To Run

npm install
npm start

## FYI

NOW TO START BOTH THE FRONTEND AND BACKEND YOU MUST RUN npm start in a separate terminal and in the other terminal node server.js or nodemon server.js because both are running on same port.
